' Show a list of folders taken from the locations of a selected set of emails.
' Also shows a FULL list of all folders with a dynamic filter box, type some chars to filter the full list
' If a folder is selected (preference given to the select folder list), file all of the selected emails to that folder.
'
' Facilitates really easy filing once you have put 1 email in a conversation to a particular folder,
' you can easily file all of the other related emails without having to hunt through all of your
' folders. Just make sure you use a view with "Conversation View" turned on.
'
' Also has a View button to switch the current view in outlook to the selected folder instead of filing.
'
' NB: Double-click on on a folder in either list is the same as pressing the "File" Button.
'
' WARNINGS: Assumed English folder names for exclusion of Inbox, Sent, etc.
'           Max 999 folders are supported, change the DIM's below if more needed
'           It is possible to end up with >1 folder when filtering, this gives an error and doesn't move - change the filter
'
' TO DO:
'   2) Add ability to move to another mailbox (http://www.slipstick.com/developer/working-vba-nondefault-outlook-folders/)
'   3) Allow multiple filters for full folder list
'   4) Pre-populate multi filters from conversation subject
'   5) List of recently selected folders
'   6) Double click to choose from recently selected folders
'   7) Send to all subfolders, not just 1st level below inbox
